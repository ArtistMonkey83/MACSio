1. Create a file in macsio/config-site directory whose name is whatever
   string the command 'hostname -f' returns. Example...
        % hostname -f
        scratlantis
        % touch macsio/config-site/scratlantis 

2. Populate the file you created in step one with variables to
   define where various third party libraries (TPLs) for plugins
   can be found. MACSio will not attempt to build any plugins
   for which the requisite TPL variables are not defined.
   Example...
        # For the silo plugin, we need Silo and, optionally, HDF5
        SILO_HOME=/foo/bar/silo/4.10.2-h5par/i386-apple-darwin12_gcc-4.2
        HDF5_HOME=/foo/bar/hdf5/1.8.11-par/i386-apple-darwin12_gcc-4.2

        # Sometimes, HDF5 needs szip and the HDF5 plugin does szip compression
        SZIP_HOME=/foo/bar/szip/2.1/i386-apple-darwin12_gcc-4.2

        # For the Exodus plugin, we need Exodus and netCDF.
        EXODUS_HOME=/foo/bar/exodus-6.09/exodus/myinstall
        NETCDF_HOME=/foo/bar/netcdf/4.1.1/i386-apple-darwin12_mpicc

3. Continue populating the file you created in step one with
   variables to control the location of C/C++ compilers, compiler
   flags, linker flags, etc. Note that a C++ compiler is used
   only to link the executables. Most of the standard GNU make
   variables are supported. Example...
        CXX=mpicxx
        CC=mpicc
        CFLAGS=-DHAVE_MPI -g
        LINK=$(CXX)
        DOXCMD=doxygen

4. Go into the macsio directory and type 'make all'. That should
   produce the 'macsio' executable. Make 'help' will give you
   some instructions on other useful make targets

5. type './macsio --help' to get command-line arguments to use/run MACSio.
