This is a modified version of the JSON-C library.

The initial version was obtained from here,
https://github.com/json-c/json-c/releases,
numbered 0.12-20140410.

It has been modified to support
     * Optimized, homogenously typed, multi-dimensional arrays.
       That is, arrays whose members are NOT json objects but
       the individual array elements in a larger buffer. These
       are 'extarr' object types.
     * Enumerated types.
     * Path-oriented object get/set methods.

These modifications have not been pushed back to JSON-C 
implementors primarily because they sorta break the JSON-C
syntax when the extra features are used.
